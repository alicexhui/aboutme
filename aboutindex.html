    <section class="about-me">
        <h2>Hi, I'm Alice Hui</h2>
        <p>I'm an aspiring environmental scientist committed to making a positive impact on both my community and the environment. Growing up in Acton, Massachusetts, I've always had a deep appreciation for nature and a strong desire to protect it. This passion has driven me to pursue this research project with Professor Bo Zhao at the University of Washington in order to raise awareness for PFAS pollution, especially in my local community.</p>

    <section class="background">
        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>I'm currently a student at Acton-Boxborough Regional High School, where I have taken a range of advanced coursework, including AP Environmental Science, AP Chemistry, and AP Biology. My academic journey has provided me with a solid foundation in both the sciences and the skills needed to tackle complex environmental issues. I also have an extensive background in competition mathematics, with experience in AMC, AIME, JMO, and AMO contests.</p>

    <section class="skills-expertise">
        <h2>My Skills and Expertise</h2>
        <p>I have developed technical skills in GIS, which I use to analyze and visualize environmental data. My experience in mapping PFAS contamination in Massachusetts allows me to contribute meaningfully to discussions about environmental health and safety. Additionally, my background in advanced mathematics and coding enhances my ability to approach problems analytically and creatively.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="motivation">
        <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
        <p>My motivation to work on environmental issues stems from my desire to ensure that everyone, regardless of their background, has access to clean and safe resources. I am particularly interested in addressing environmental injustices, where marginalized communities often bear the brunt of pollution and inadequate regulations. By raising awareness about these issues and advocating for stronger environmental protections, I hope to contribute to a healthier and more equitable world.</p>

    <section class="outside-of-work">
        <h2>Outside of Work</h2>
        <p>When I'm not immersed in my studies or research, I enjoy indulging in my creative side through oil painting and baking. I love painting landscapes and am currently experimenting with glow-in-the-dark portraits. Baking is another passion of mine, especially when I get to incorporate Chinese flavors like sesame into my creations. Reading is also a favorite pastime, with "Little Women" by Louisa May Alcott being one of my all-time favorite novels. Additionally, I find joy in the methodical process of building complex Lego setsâ€”most recently, a 6,000-piece Hogwarts castle.</p>
